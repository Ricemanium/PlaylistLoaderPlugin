# PlaylistLoaderPlugin
This plugin uses the official Playlist loader to load custom playlist files in Beat Saber.
This mod isn't a replacement for PlaylistCore and does not load songs that aren't locally available. Instead, it is for people who prefer a more lightweight mod for loading playlists in the game's native playlist UI.

## Features
- Support for JSON custom playlists
- Loads custom playlists in the official playlists UI
- Allows refreshing playlists using the "Refresh Playlists" button in the Mods tab

## Download
Download the latest version of the mod (v0.2.0) [here](https://github.com/rithik-b/PlaylistLoaderPlugin/releases/tag/0.2.0 "here")
